# Genetic Studies of Neurofibromatosis - Cutaneous Neurofibroma Cell Lines 

NF1 cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) have some similarities to non-cutaneous (plexiform) neurofibromas, but there are also differences whose molecular bases are not well characterized. There is also heterogeneity within cNFs, e.g. NF1 mutations and phenotypes. To improve our understanding of cNF biology, we will develop characterized cNF Schwann cell two-hit cultures/lines, and perform exome RNA sequence analysis in these resources as well as primary tissue (intact and isolated single cells). Heterozygous Schwann cell lines will also be developed and studied from some of the same tumors.
